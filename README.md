# STAT-340 Mini Projects
### Applied Regression Methods

#### Mini Project 1
The wine industry is investing in new technologies for both wine making and selling processes. Wine certification and quality assessment are key elements within this context. Certification prevents the illegal adulteration of wines (to safeguard human health) and assures quality for the wine market. Wine certification is generally assessed by physicochemical and sensory tests. Physicochemical laboratory tests routinely used to characterize wine include determination of density, alcohol or pH values, while sensory tests rely mainly on
human experts.

In this mini-project, we are interested in learning about the variables that may be related to the wine density.

We will use the dataset "wine" and focus on the following variables:

• `density`: the wine density measured in grams per milliliter (g/mL)

• `citric_acidity`: amount of citric acid per liter (g/L)

• `residual_sugar`: amount of residual sugar per liter (g/L)

• `chlorides`: amount of sodium chloride per liter (g/L)

• `total_sulfur_dioxide`: total amount of sulfur dioxide per liter (mg/L)

• `alcohol`: percentage of alcohol in the wine (% vol)
